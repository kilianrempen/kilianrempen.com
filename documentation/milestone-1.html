    <h2>Purpose, Audience, & Goal</h2>
    <div>
        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>The purpose of this portfolio website is to showcase the work I have done in the past, and to give an idea of what kind of work I could provide to a prospective employer or client. I intend to include projects from my previous jobs as a Marketing Manager, CRM Manager, and Systems Administrator. There will be a heavy bias towards marketing projects, since that is where I've spent the longest in my career so far, but many of those projects are very website-centric.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Audience</h2>
        <p>The main user of this website at first will be prospective employers, as a showcase of why they should hire me. After the bootcamp, I intend to keep building and updating the website as a record of my own work that lives and grows. I'd like to be able to show it to friends, family members, or anyone, to showcase what I've been working on and what I do. But at first, I'll focus on the prospective employer audience as the user.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Goal</h2>
        <p>The main goal will be to use this website to gain employment after the bootcamp. In the future I also plan to use it as a gallery of the work I've done in the past, so it won't be 100% focused on what I can do as a web developer. I'm hoping the website itself serves as proof I can build a website from scratch, and the content will be made up of a lot of marketing and web design work I've done in the past.</p>
        <p><em>TL,DR: The initial goal is to get a job in web development or a similar field by showcasing what I can do.</em></p>

        <h2>Persona</h2>
        <h3>Harmon "HR" Rickenbacker</h3>
            <p>Harmon is the office & hiring manager at a small web development company making custom websites for small businesses.</p>
        <h4>Technology:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Harmon works on a Dell Optiplex running Windows 10.</li>
                <li>He is perfectly proficient with computers for daily tasks, web browsing, email, etc.</li>
                <li>Harmon uses an Android phone but prefers to work on his desktop if possible.</li>
                <li>Harmon knows enough about web development to know what he's looking for in a new hire.</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Behaviors & Attitudes:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Harmon loves computers, he thinks websites are really neat, and likes the artistic side of them more than the functional side.</li>
                <li>His favorite part of this workday will be looking at applicants' websites and the ideas they've come up with to present themselves.</li>
                <li>Harmon is easy-going, not rushed, and is willing to take a good few minutes to look at each website properly.</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Our Situation/Scenario:</h4>
        <p>Harmon is looking to bring on new developers to handle the company's growing workload.</p>
        <p>He knows there are plenty of good coders out there, but he wants an employee that can help their clients put together a vision of what their website will look like and how it will function.</p>
        <p>Currently, the biggest frustration is finding a good fit for the company.<br><em>Navigating new websites is not frustrating to Harmon at all.</em></p>
        <p>He's hoping one of these applicants will have a great looking professional portfolio that paints a full picture of the applicant and makes his decision easy.</p>
        <h4>Harmon's Goal:</h4>
        <p>Harmon's goal in using this website is to find someone who demonstrates knowledge in building a good website and branding themselves, ideally with a few years' experience in related fields.</p>
