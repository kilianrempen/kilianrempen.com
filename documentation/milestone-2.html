<h1>PWP Milestone 2 - Content Strategy & Wireframes</h1>

<section id="prettySection">
<p>This website will be 1 page, with a navigation bar at the top on desktop, hamburger on mobile, (maybe sticky?) that will scroll the user to the appropriate content rather than open a new page. In the future, I might change this to a multi-page design, so sections will be clear.</p>

<h2>Content</h2>
<h3>Banner Image & Introduction</h3>
<p>A well-considered hero image with me in it, OR a photo of my home office workspace with a dark overlay and light text. The hero image will have my name on it as the headline, and either "professional portfolio" or something like "Marketing and Web Development Professional that describes me".</p>
<h4>Horizontal nav bar here to go to different portfolio sections (this will likely be the sticky nav, instead of traditional home/contact/etc at very top. Will stick to top as user scrolls past it):</h4>
<p>Potential topics include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Web Development</li>
    <li>Website Design</li>
    <li>CRM / ERP Management</li>
    <li>Copywriting</li>
    <li>Branding</li>
    <li>PR / Long-form Writing</li>
    <li>Audio / Video</li>
    <li>Print & Digital Advertising</li>
    <li>Product Management / Photography</li>
    <li>Product Design / Packaging Design</li>
    <li>Systems Administration</li>
    <li>Logos / Graphic Design</li>
</ul>

<h3>About Me Section</h3>
<p>A quick introduction to me, what I'm into, and what kind of services I provide. This section will cover my past work experience at a higher level, including industries I've been a part of and positions I've held.</p>

<h3>Portfolio</h3>
<h4>Organized by type of work</h4>
<p>This section will include a series of galleries that cover different types of projects I've done. When an item is clicked on, I would like a short case-study / description of ONE project I've done in that area, that I'm most proud of, to pop up (modal box?) detailing what I did and the result. Each item should have a title and description under an image, in a bounding box.</p>

<h3>Contact</h3>
<p>This section will include a simple contact form that sends an email to my @gmail address. Also, links to my LinkedIn and GitHub</p>
